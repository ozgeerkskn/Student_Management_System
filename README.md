# Student_Management_System
Student Management System - This system is written in Java Swing and I use Apache NetBeans IDE 18
The system is currently at a very basic level. However, it is under development.
Student Management System consists of 3 main parts:
Student (Add / Manage)
Course(Add / Manage)
Score (Add / Edit-Delete / Manage )

New student registration can be done through the system. This record can be edited or deleted.
Courses and course hours can be added through the system. These actions can be edited or deleted later.
Student score information can be entered through the system. The "Calculate" button calculates the student's 
letter grade according to the entered score information. The "Add" button saves the data.
Please review the "All Scores" table to see all the data in detail.

I'm currently working on the schedule part. -> Will be added soon:)

Follow the steps below to login to the system:
1) Create a database in phpmyadmin. The name of the database is preferably "stdmngdb".
2) Import the file named "stdmngdb.sql" located in the DB folder.
3) Username and passwords to login to the system:  (Ignore the "/" sign.)
